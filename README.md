# Self Driving Car

I've enrolled for Udacity's course on [Self Driving Car](https://in.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) starting April 2018.
This repository has my submissions to SDC assignments and useful links.

## Term1

### Finding Lanes

This is first assignment for term 1 and requied detecting lanes on road using OpenCV library.
My model worked well under good lighting conditions, but fails on some parts of the optional challenge video.
Take a look at the [model](https://github.com/aniryou/Udacity_SDC/blob/master/CarND-LaneLines-P1/P1.ipynb) and [writeup](https://github.com/aniryou/Udacity_SDC/blob/master/CarND-LaneLines-P1/writeup_lane_finding.md).

### Traffic Sign Classification

This is second assignment for term 1 and required building a classifier for [German Traffic Sign dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)
It also covers deep-learning topics and tensorflow library in depth.
Take a look at [LeNet Lab](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-TensorFlow-Lab) and [Tensorflow Lab](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-TensorFlow-Lab).

Using standard LeNet model with [Batch Normalization](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers/batch_normalization) and [Dropout](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/dropout) I was able to get above 93% validation accuracy.
Here are links to the [model](https://github.com/aniryou/Udacity_SDC/blob/master/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) and [writeup](https://github.com/aniryou/Udacity_SDC/blob/master/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/writeup_traffic_sign_classifier.md).
